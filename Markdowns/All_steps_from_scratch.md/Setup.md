#We opened a project on atlas

# then we created a cluster so we can have a database for the project on the cloud, becuase we are going to deploy the project we need to have it on the cloud instead of locally, easier and more convenient.

# registrations from the cluster for who can read and write from the database, also whitelising ips if needed.
